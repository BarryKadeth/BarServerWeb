# BarServerWeb

This is my personal website (January 2023): 

It was previously created with PHP as the server language. Used Azure services such as: 
- App service
- MySQL database
- Key vault
- Virtual machine. 

I have no removed these and made the website static with no PHP code, using GoogleDocs for the forms. 
This website is now hosted on Github Pages
